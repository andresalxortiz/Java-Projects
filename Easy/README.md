## TIPS
1) Every file should be named after the main public class.
- __"Main.java"__

<pre><code>// Notice how the name of the public class matches exactly with the name of the .java file.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("This is an example of a program.");
  }
}</code></pre>

2) You can only have one Top-level public classes followed by class instances within a file. 
3) You can also create multiple .java files, each with their own public class, and compile them together within the same directory.

### Keywords:
- ***static***: A member of a class that isn't associated with an instance of a class. Therefore it holds the same value(s) across multiple class instances.

- ***void***: A function of type `void` does not expect a return value.
